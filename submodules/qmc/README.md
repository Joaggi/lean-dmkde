Quantum Measurement Classification
============================================================

Implementation of some machine learning algorithms using density matrices from quantum mechanics. Particularly, the library provides support for

- Density matrix kernel density estimation
- Density matrix kernel density classification
- Quantum measurement classification
- Quantum measurement regression

# Getting Started

You can install the most recent version of the library with

```zsh
pip install git+https://github.com/fagonzalezo/qmc.git
```

Check our [examples](https://github.com/fagonzalezo/qmc/tree/master/examples) to see what you can do!
